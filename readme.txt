Created by [Julie Cameron](http://juliecameron.com/). Based off the [SlickQuiz jQuery plugin](https://github.com/JewlOfTheLotus/SlickQuiz).

The SlickQuiz WordPress Plugin is now open source - contribute on [Github](https://github.com/JewlOfTheLotus/SlickQuiz-WordPress)


== Installation ==

1. Install the SlickQuiz plugin directly from the WordPress plugin directory. Or upload the SlickQuiz plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
1. Create / publish quizzes via the "SlickQuizzes" option in the WordPress sidebar.
1. To add a quiz to a post or page, place `[slickquiz id=X]` the content area, where `X` is the ID of the quiz you created. The ID can be found in the main SlickQuiz listing.

= Dynamic URL Shortcode Setup =

You may also dynamically render a quiz by setting the shortcode to `[slickquiz id=url]`.  This will tell the plugin to look for an ID at **the end of the page URL** and select the quiz with that ID. Note: additional query string parameters will not interfere.

= Text Widget Setup =

To use the `[slickquiz id=X]` shortcode in the sidebar Text widget, add the following to yours theme's `functions.php` file.

`add_filter( 'widget_text', 'do_shortcode' )`

= Developer Hooks =

There are currently three filter actions that you may hook into:

`slickquiz_admin_options` - This allows you to add custom admin options.

`slickquiz_after_options` - This allows you to add custom markup to the bottom of SlickQuiz Options form (you would likely add data to your custom `slickquiz_admin_options` here).

`slickquiz_after_result` - This allows you to add custom markup to the bottom of the quiz results area at the end of the quiz (you would likely output data from your custom `slickquiz_admin_options` here).

For an example of how to utilize these hooks, see this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/jewlofthelotus/9022902).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I see the quiz Preview? =

The quiz Preview opens in a popup window. You may need to allow popups for the domain in your browser. Check the URL bar for a popup-blocked indicator and click it for more information.

= Why isn't the quiz showing up on my page? OR why is the quiz broken? =

There are a lot of reasons this could be happening - usually there is an issue with the theme or a conflict with another plugin. Here are a few things to look for:

* Make sure your theme's `footer.php` template contains the following code snippet - this ensures that plugins are able to add necessary code to the page.

`<?php wp_footer(); ?>`

* Check your browser's Development Console for errors. Click [here](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) for instructions on how to find to this panel in your browser (Note: if you're on a Mac, use the `Command âŒ˜` key in place of `CTRL`). Once you've got it open, look for anything in red - it will all look pretty foreign, but if you see anything in red, scan the text for keywords that might indicate the plugin the error is coming from. Try disabling those plugins and then see if the quiz loads.
* Still having trouble? Create a new [support ticket](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/slickquiz/) with the details of your issue.

= Can I add pictures to my questions / answers / responses? =

Yes, you can place any HTML tags that you like within any of the content fields. For images, get the URL of the image you want to add, and use something like the following to add the image to a content area:

`<img src="/uploads/2014/02/my_photo.jpg">`

= Is there a way to email user scores and answers? =

Yes, if you "Enable sharing buttons" from the SlickQuiz Options page, your users will have a button to email their results at the end of the quiz.  Currently, this feature does not capture all answers - only the user's overall score and ranking.

= Can I put the same quiz on the same page multiple times? =

Nope, things will break.  This might happen if you place the same quiz within multiple blog posts and more than one of those posts is displayed on the page.

= I've got an idea for a feature or have a bug to report, what should I do? =

Checkout the [SlickQuiz WordPress Support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/slickquiz/) to see if someone else has experienced your issue, the answer might already be there; if not - please create a new support ticket!

Also, see the [SlickQuiz Issues](https://github.com/jewlofthelotus/SlickQuiz-WordPress/issues) page on Github for a complete list of upcoming features and bug fixes, and feel free to add your own ideas!
